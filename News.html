            Hello ACM members! We are fast approaching a month since classes resumed! Learning can be especially hard for some right now.
            It is important to find a reliable study method and a good network. Do not hesitate to communicate needs with others. With the right dynamic, at the end of all this, we can become self-made individuals.

            <p> Interested in game development with a hint of AI/ML? Then the beginners project is right for you! Get a chance to rebuild the original flappy bird game, but with a twist- while you can manually play the game, you'll also be able to work with machine learning concepts to build an AI that could play the game perfectly. Using Python and important concepts like object oriented programming, you'll be able to learn about designing projects and how to create a user interface with the Pygame library.
